For the Command Parsing Step:

1 - Design the command-line interface (CLI): Define the commands and their syntax that users will interact with to perform operations on the file system.

2 - Implement the command parser: Develop a parser that can interpret the user's input and identify the command, arguments, and options.

3 - Create a command executor: Implement a component that takes the parsed command and executes the corresponding action on the file system.

4 - Integrate the command parser and executor with the existing file system implementation: Ensure that the commands correctly interact with the file system objects, such as creating, deleting, moving, renaming, and copying files and directories based on user input.

5 - Test the command-line interface: Design and execute test cases to verify the correctness of the command parsing and execution, including scenarios with different combinations of commands, arguments, and options.

6 - Refine and improve the command-line interface: Gather feedback, identify potential improvements or enhancements, and make necessary adjustments to enhance usability and user experience.

7 - Document the command-line interface: Provide clear instructions and documentation on how to use the CLI, including the available commands, their syntax, and examples of their usage.
