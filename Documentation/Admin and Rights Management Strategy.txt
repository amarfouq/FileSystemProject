For this part we need to think further to understand the implementation of permissions in our code.
So far, We created a class node to have a hierachical tree where the class "site" sits on top of our tree, and we also have 3 others classes "Client, Directory and File".
The only notion of security that were previously introduced are protection of a file (or directory) and ownership.

*** New notions of access rights management ***

1 - Group Rights:
	We want to create groups to have more flexible way of managing permissions and inheritance.
	
2 - RWX system:
	Like in most OS, we want to permit some users to only read, while other to write or even execute
	
3 - Inheritance of Permissions:
	Now with the current system of permissions, the desing has a flaw, which is that we don't have a clear policy on the inheritance of permissions
	
4 - Audit logs:
	This is a bonus, but it will track all the new change that can occur on a file
